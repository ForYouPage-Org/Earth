# EARTH MEMORANDUM

**To:** The FYP Event Committee & FYP Leadership Team  
**From:** Marx Wang  
**Date:** July 16, 2025  
**Subject:** Proposal: Project Earth – A Global Youth Health & Wellbeing Alliance

---

## Executive Summary

In an era of rising nationalism, global instability, and retreating democracies, the health of the world's youth is threatened by interlocking crises of mental health, digital misinformation, and non-communicable diseases. Traditional public health models are too fragmented and slow to respond effectively, and too detached from the state of the real youth.

We propose **Project Earth**: an alliance for youth health, structured as a collective defense partnership analogous to NATO. Project Earth will unite leading NGOs and youth organizations under a single banner, leveraging FYP's media and e-commerce infrastructure (Project Mars) to launch joint media, fundraising and accountability campaigns for the health and happiness of all youth, led by youth.

## Strategic Framework: Three Pillars for Impact

### Pillar I: The Media Engine – Forging a New Culture of Health

We will move beyond PSAs to create culture. By funding and co-creating high-impact media with partners, we will arm a generation with the tools to normalize help-seeking, counter harmful digital trends, and leverage cross-culture members' way of life to liberate a compassionate stereotype-impossible world. This is a direct execution of our value of Agency and Authenticity.

#### Key Initiatives:

1. **Edutainment at Scale:** We'll replicate proven models like MTV's Shuga, where evaluation showed viewers were twice as likely to test for HIV.

2. **Counter-Marketing Harmful Norms:** We will launch aggressive campaigns to deconstruct toxic trends in body image, substance use, and mental health, similar to the "Truth" anti-smoking campaign.

3. **Youth-Led Content:** Empower a global network of youth creators to produce and share their own stories, ensuring our movement is driven by peer-to-peer truth, not top-down messaging.

### Pillar II: The Economic Engine – A Unified Fundraising Architecture

We will build a self-sustaining economic model that embodies our value of Compassion and Openness by bypassing traditional gatekeepers and channeling resources directly to grassroots action. We build on a sustainable, hybrid economic model that combines institutional stability with platform-native innovation, leveraging the Project Mars infrastructure.

#### Key Components:

**Fundraising-as-a-Service:** We will integrate a powerful fundraising layer into the FYP platform, featuring:

- **Point-of-Sale Micro-donations:** "Round-up" features on all Project Mars transactions
- **Integrated Crowdfunding:** A portal for users to directly fund partner campaigns
- **Social Impact Centered:** Cause-marketing products that turn consumption into collective action

**Demonstrated ROI:** This model is highly efficient. Precedents like the MTV Staying Alive Foundation show that for every $1 invested, an estimated $150 in health benefits is returned to the community.

### Pillar III: The Accountability Mechanism – From Transparency to Influence

We will evolve from a media coalition into a globally respected institution that holds power accountable and drives systemic change, embodying our theory that personal flourishing drives collective transformation.

#### Strategic Actions:

1. **Transparency:** Fund partner-led media and investigative reports on youth health issues.

2. **Index:** Launch FYP Slay Index, a powerful annual report ranking countries on key metrics to generate public pressure and media attention.

3. **Influence:** Establish a High-Level Council to use the Index for direct diplomatic and policy engagement with governments and international bodies.
