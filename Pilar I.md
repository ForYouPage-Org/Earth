# CONFIDENTIAL BRIEFING: PROJECT EARTH MEDIA PILLAR

**To:** The FYP Event Committee & FYP Leadership Team  
**From:** Marx Wang  
**Date:** July 16, 2025  
**Subject:** Proposal: Project Earth – A Global Youth Health & Wellbeing Alliance

---

## **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

The collapse of traditional media gatekeepers and rise of AI-driven content presents both an existential threat and historic opportunity for individual pursuit of well-being and collective pursuit of happiness globally. This ancillary briefing proposes an aligned media infrastructure that transforms passive consumption into active community health engagement, delivering measurable returns on national health investments while strengthening democratic resilience.

## **VALUE PROPOSITION**

### I. Strategic Opportunity
The global creator economy has reached $200-250 billion in 2025 and is projected to grow to $528 billion by 2030, presenting an unprecedented opportunity to deploy media as public health infrastructure. Recent meta-analyses show digital media interventions produce positive behavioral changes across multiple health domains, vastly outperforming traditional PSAs that achieve <2% behavior change.

### II. FYP's Unique Position  
FYP Media operates not as a content producer but as quality-assured infrastructure connecting youth creators with youth audiences. With 207 million content creators worldwide and 81% of Gen Z spending 1+ hours daily on social media, our model transforms media from passive consumption to active participation, with built-in economic incentives aligned to self-love commitments rather than engagement metrics.

### III. National Security & Public Health Returns
Mental health issues cost the U.S. economy $282 billion annually—1.7% of consumption, with mental ill-health driving economic costs of up to 4% of GDP globally. A coordinated media infrastructure can significantly reduce this burden while strengthening democratic resilience against disinformation—critical as 34% of Americans now use social media as their primary news source, up from 4% in 2015.



## RISK MITIGATION FRAMEWORK

| **Risk Category** | **Mitigation Strategy** |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Content Quality** | Rigorous editorial oversight by health professionals; hybrid screening; clear boundaries (no direct care provision) |
| **Political Manipulation** | apolitical launch focus on health; transparent governance; multi-stakeholder oversight |
| **Harmful Peer Support** | Certified creator training; 24/7 crisis referral systems |
| **Economic Sustainability** | Hybrid model: institutional funding + user micro-commitments; proven ROI metrics |

## CRITICAL SUPPORTING DATA

- **Creator Economy Scale:** 207 million content creators globally; market valued at $250 billion in 2025
- **Youth Media Consumption:** Global average daily digital media consumption is 7 hours and 12 minutes; 90% of teens use YouTube, with 57% visiting TikTok daily
- **Health Impact Evidence:** Meta-analysis shows positive effects of multi-behavior interventions (d = 0.081–2.003); Social media interventions may positively affect physical activity, weight loss, and well-being
- **Economic Multiplier:** Each dollar invested in scaling mental health interventions could have an economic return of $5 to $6 in global GDP
- **News Source Shift:** 42% of Europeans aged 16-30 rely mainly on social media platforms for news about politics and social issues
